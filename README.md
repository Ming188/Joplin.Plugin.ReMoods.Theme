## Recommend Fonts 

ReMoods Theme tested over 50 free fonts from 10px to 16px, light to dark background, long hours of reading, etc. I finally picked the fonts below: 

- Base Font Winner: Montserrat
- Monospace Font Winner: Cascadia Mono Light 
- Traditional & Simplified Chinese Font Winner: Chiron Hei Hk Text Extralight 

They are all working great with ReMoods, and I was developing everything for this theme based on using these fonts.

## Heading

### Hints

1. For the headings you always use with a border, you can enable the heading's border through the settings page.
2. For the headings you want to add border flexibly, you can manually be adding `---` behind the heading at any time.
3. Enable the heading reference will appear in front of the headings.
4. When using emoji within the H1 heading, you should use `<span></span>` to wrap it up.

## Text Styles

Some of the text color would change with the theme color.

Let's compare the difference after the theme color changed:

## Code Block Syntax Highlight

ReMoods Theme provides over 80% consistent syntax highlighting styles for the code block of Markdown Editor and Render Viewer.

![Screenshot 2022-09-26 000631](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192153453-4d51e804-769d-47f8-abac-0794ad4266a1.png)


## Floating TOC 

Joplin provides us a great built-in Markdown TOC feature which let you create the TOC by typing a simple command `[[toc]]` within your notes. ReMoods has restyle it and made it floating at the bottom right of the Render Viewer.

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 032314](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192115112-9432ac02-94de-4894-b0a6-3fcc8333d32f.png)

The Markdown TOC feature is disable by Joplin default. To use the Markdown TOC, you should enable the the extension manually.

### Hints

To enable the TOC feature:
1. Go to `Options > Markdown`
2. Checked `Enable table of contents extension (wysiwyg:no)`

## Eye-Protector

All attached images and mermaid charts will default to 20% darker than the original, to avoid bright light flickering your eyes while reading the notes. Hovering over them will restore the original brightness slowly.

You can disable it by go to `Options > ReMoods Theme` and unchecked the `Enable Eye-Protector effect for mermaid charts` or `Enable Eye-Protector effect for images`.

![EyeProtector](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/154980775-2df6b700-ae1a-4a4d-b0f8-a9f99a60484f.jpg)

# Custom Elements 

ReMoods Theme provides a lot of custom elements to help you create a better reading experience on the Render Viewer and Export HTML File. If Joplin is your only place to taking notes, you can just use Custom Elements without thinking. Otherwise, you should notice the below:

1. Custom Elements are unique HTML Elements and CSS Styles for ReMoods Theme, so it might become plain text format when you transfer your notes to other software.
2. Even if other software is support customize CSS, you should still need to copy the related codes from ReMoods to your new software manually.

## Art Gallery 

Art Gallery provides 11 custom elements for you to split attached images into columns. It would be helpful if you have many images needed to attach to your note. 

Art Gallery has limited the `max-height` to 60% viewport height by default. Let's see how its work:

| Custom Elements | Force Columns |
|:---------------:|:-------------:|
|       ag2       |       2       |
|       ag3       |       3       |
|       ag4       |       4       |
|       ag5       |       5       |
|       ag6       |       6       |
|       ag7       |       7       |
|       ag8       |       8       |
|       ag9       |       9       |
|       ag10      |       10      |
|       ag11      |       11      |
|       ag12      |       12      |

Below is the sample of the art gallery(ag6) with 30 images: 

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 171257](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192136954-9ef7c0e7-9bf7-466d-a945-dcc222df3ff1.png)

### Hints

1. The custom element name `ag` stands for *Art Gallery*.
2. The art gallery tag must use *right behind the plain text* .
3. Do not including any blank line within this part of the codes, *blank line will break the format* .

## Sticky Notes 

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 193253](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192141288-388a53d8-e9d2-4177-9ef8-40ebb4149d01.png)

## Custom Title Block

Custom Title Block would be suitable for supplementing information that you think is important to readers. The usage is very similar to a blockquote but come up with a clear heading, it's making a key concept more outstanding.

Let's see what it looks like:

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 180612](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192138206-2c66c33d-5121-40bf-a5aa-2227d17c8260.png)

### Hints

1. The custom element name `ctb` stands for *Custom Title Block*.
2. Type your title *next to the open tag* .
3. Keep your title *within one line*.
4. Start typing your content *in the second line*.
5. Use plain text within a custom element.
6. Please mention that *within one line* means it's *according to your panel width*.

## Key Point

The custom element Key Point is super useful while you want to split out a paragraph without using the Heading or Strong Text. It also can keeps your mind clear from the sense of overly using the Strong Text or Heading. The usage is very similar to the HTML Description List element.

3 best timing to use the Key Point:

1. To keep *multiple paragraph* of contents stay within *one heading*.
2. To *explain a part of content* that with *multiple key points* and each one have *a paragraph of description*.
3. To avoiding using Strong Text to *create a paragraph*. (keep your strong text only appear within a paragraph content.)

See it below:

### Hints

1. The custom element name `kp` stands for *Key Point*.
2. I recommend **only** use it at *the beginning of line*.
3. It **cannot** be used within *any other block elements* such as Custom Title Block, Spoiler Block, Sticky Notes, etc...

## Key Mention

The custom element Key Mention is use for

### Hints

1. The custom element name `km` stands for *Key Mention*.
2. Always use `km` **right behind the target element** which you want to describe for.
3. Use with the Joplin built-in function `Insert Date Time` make you easy.
4. You can also use `km` within any Sticky Notes, and if you do that, please make sure `km` is always the **first child** inside the Sticky Notes.
5. The text strong, emphasize, insert, and strikethrough will present as red color when inside the `km`.
6. Mouse hover on it to zoom bigger.

# Third-Party Plugins Styling 

## Spoiler 

This plugin allows you to create inline spoilers and spoiler blocks with title and extendable body. And the below shows what Spoiler looks like in ReMoods:

Let's take a look to the spoiler block:

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 233436](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192151983-f7da56cc-add8-4638-9224-60abeb4894c7.png)

### Hints

ReMoods has been created 4 more custom styles that you can use within the Spoiler block for advanced usage:

2. Spoiler Block > List
3. Spoiler Block > List > Span
4. Spoiler Block > Custom Title Block

Quick setting up:

1. Open Joplin
2. Go to `tools` > `Options` > `Plugins`
3. Search the plugin by inputting the word `spoiler`
4. Click `Install` which is on the `Spoiler`
5. Quit & restart Joplin app

## Markdown Table Colorize

This plugin adds colors to Joplin markdown table syntax so you can quickly identify what column the content belongs to.

Sometimes, Markdown table syntax can be very messy when too much information is within the table. Thanks to the Markdown Table Colorize plugin, OhmineDT can create a better style for the markdown table now!

After installing the Markdown Table Colorize plugin and ReMoods, you will see the markdown table syntax looks like below:

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 234159](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192152301-b4e3608d-f4f7-4191-a80e-8f804b117dc9.png)

- Separating table rows into independent sections
- Use colored letters as a column mark
- Column marks support up to 52 columns
- Mouse hover on the column mark to zoom bigger

### Hints

I would like to share the steps of how I create a markdown table. And these steps are perfect for this plugin style.

First to create the table structure:

```
||||||
||||||
||||||
```

Then, add the format to it:

```
||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|
||||||
```

Last, add content to it:

```
|TH|TH|TH|TH|TH|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|TD|TD|TD|TD|TD|
```

Quick setting up:

1. Open Joplin
2. Go to `tools` > `Options` > `Plugins`
3. Search the plugin by inputting the word `color`
4. Click `Install` on the `Markdown Table: Colorize`
5. Quit & restart Joplin app
