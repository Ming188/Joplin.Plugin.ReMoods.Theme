# REMOODS THEME GETTING START [IMPORTANT]

ReMoods has been styling lots of Joplin elements, and all of them are helpful to you. However, some of the effects are highly reliant on the Joplin built-in settings and third-party plugins to get work, so you may need to follow the below guides to get 100% of what ReMoods Theme brings to you!

Let's go for it one by one!

## Change The Joplin Built-in Theme

**ReMoods needs to run with the Joplin built-in Dark theme. Otherwise, it might cause some of the colors abnormal:**

1. Open Joplin
2. Go to `tools` > `Options` >`Appearance` > `Theme`
3. Choose `Dark`
4. Click `Apply`

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Change The Joplin Built-in Markdown Settings

**ReMoods has styled the special text, but some of them didn't turn on by Joplin default, so you should turn them on manually:**

1. Open Joplin
2. Go to `tools` > `Options` >`Markdown` 
3. Enable the below options depend on yourr needs: 
	- `Enable math expressions (wysiwyg: yes)`
	- `Enable Mermaid diagrams support (wysiwyg: yes)`
	- `Enable ==mark== syntax (wysiwyg: yes)`
	- `Enable footnotes (wysiwyg: no)`
	- `Enable table of contents extension (wysiwyg: no)`
	- `Enable ~sub~ syntax (wysiwyg: yes)`
	- `Enable ^sup^ syntax (wysiwyg: yes)`
	- `Enable abbreviation syntax (wysiwyg: no)`
	- `Enable ++insert++ syntax (wysiwyg: yes)`
4. Click `Apply`

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Install And Setting The Required Plugin: Rich Markdown

**ReMoods is relying on the "Rich Markdown" plugin to style the text because Joplin didn't provide enough CSS classes to specify those elements. So, it would cause some styles to be missing from ReMoods while you didn't install this plugin, or you didn't enable the settings:**

1. Open Joplin
2. Go to `tools` > `Options` > `Plugins`
3. Search the plugin by inputting the word `rich`
4. Click `Install` on the `Rich Markdown`
5. Quit & restart Joplin app
6. Go to `Tools`, `Options`, `Rich Markdown`
7. Enable the `Add additional CSS classes for enhanced customization`
8. Click `Apply`

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Install And Setting The Helpful Plugin: Quick HTML Tags [Optional] 

**The "Quick HTML Tags" plugin provides you with a quick and easy way to create HTML tags in your notes, and it's helpful to create the custom elements of ReMoods:**

1. Copy this line of text:  `kp;span;ctb;km;ag;note;tip;explain;question;comment;keyword;important;`
2. Open Joplin
3. Go to `Tools` > `Options` > `Plugins`
4. Search the plugin by inputting the word `html`
5. Click `Install` on the `Quick HTML Tags` plugin
6. Quit & restart Joplin app
7. Go to `Tools` > `Options` > `Quick HTML Tags`
8. Go to `HTML predefined tags` 
9. Paste the text in the input bar
10. Click `OK`

After this, you can use this plugin like below:

1. Whenever you want to use an HTML tag just press  `ctrl + h`
2. Then, press the `Down` key on your keyboard to find the right tag
3. Press the `Enter` key. It's done!

Please mention that the `<ag>` is not a complete custom element name. You should add a number on it every time, such as `<ag4>`, `<ag8>` etc... Art Gallery lets you create 2 to 12 columns for images, so each time you create an `ag` tag with the Quick HTML Tags plugin, just don't forget to give it a number.

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Download And Install Recommended Fonts [OPTIONAL]

**ReMoods Theme has been tested over 50 free fonts from 10px to 16px, and I was developing everything for this theme based on using the below fonts, so I recommend you use them: (They are the default fonts for ReMoods)**

- Base Font: Montserrat
- Monospace Font: Cascadia Mono Light 
- Traditional & Simplified Chinese Font: Chiron Hei Hk Text Extralight 

Here is the abridged version of the font packages, and I have uploaded them to my Google Drive; you can download the exact files you need at the below link: 

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SEBEVGpBrXFlmOtVzyqnhEVuO7Vrp61Y?usp=sharing 

Each abridged version contains: 

- Montserrat (TTF) 
- Cascadia Mono (TTF/OTF) 
- Chiron Hei HK Text (TTF/OTF) 

Alternatively, if you are interested to download the original complete packages, you can download them by visiting the official pages below: 

- Montserrat: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat 
- Cascadia Code: https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases 
- Chiron Hei HK: https://github.com/chiron-fonts/chiron-hei-hk/releases 

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## A Temporary Solution Of Customize The Theme Color & Font-Related Settings [IMPORTANT]

Currently, some of the core settings properties are not available on the ReMoods Theme's settings page because I don't know how to implement them. So, for an alternative, you could edit the theme color and font-related settings through your `userstyle.css` and `chromestyle.css` manually:

Please copy the below codes and paste them to the correct CSS stylesheet:

1. Copy the below codes
```
:root {
  /* For render viewer and rich text editor */
  --usp-remoods-hue: 213deg; /* The theme color hue setting, must include "deg" after the numbers which between 0 to 360. */
  --usp-base-font: "montserrat","chiron hei hk text extralight";
  --usp-monospace-font: "cascadia mono light", "chiron hei hk text extralight";
  --usp-base-font-size: 14px;
  --usp-smaller-monospace-font-size: 86%;
  
  /* For print & export pdf */
  --usp-print-base-font: "montserrat","chiron hei hk text extralight";
  --usp-print-monospace-font: "cascadia mono light", "chiron hei hk text extralight";
  --usp-print-base-font-size: 12px;
  --usp-print-monospace-font-size: 10px;
}
```
2. Open Joplin
3. Go to `Options` > `Appearance`
4. Click `Show Advanced Settings`
5. Click `Custom Stylesheet for rendered Markdown` and it will open the `userstyle.css` file
6. Paste the codes to the `userstyle.css` and back to the guide
7. Then, copy the below codes
```
:root {
  /* For markdown editor */
  --usp-remoods-hue: 213deg; /* The theme color hue setting, must include "deg" after the numbers which between 0 to 360. */
  --usp-base-font: "montserrat","chiron hei hk text extralight";
  --usp-monospace-font: "cascadia mono light", "chiron hei hk text extralight";
  --usp-base-font-size: 14px;
  --usp-smaller-monospace-font-size: 86%;
}

/* Avoid white background when starting Joplin */
body {
  background-color: hsl(var(--usp-remoods-hue),  8%,  27%) !important;
}
```
8. Back to Joplin
9. Click `Custom Stylesheet for Joplin-wide app styles` and it will open the `chromestyle.css` file
10. Paste the codes to the `userstyle.css`.
11. Now, you can edit the value of these two stylesheets to control those settings.
12. After editing the values, close the files then quit and restart Joplin. It's done!

# LOOK & FEEL

Remoods is expecting to try its best to create a comfortable and useful theme for you. Maybe you wouldn't feel it at once by reading this document, but I believe that you would feel it slowly throughout the time you use it.

While I did many little pieces of stuff for this theme, I can't show you everything through this document, but I would like to show you some of them! Below show you some screenshots and tell you some key concepts of use.

## Customizable Heading 

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 164824](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192136884-4a05f5e1-8e36-45c0-b880-fb8252b1ebce.png)

### Hints

1. For the headings you always use with a border, you can enable the heading's border through the settings page.
2. For the headings you want to add border flexibly, you can manually be adding `---` behind the heading at any time.
3. Enable the heading reference will appear in front of the headings.
4. When using emoji within the H1 heading, you should use `<span></span>` to wrap it up.

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 203245](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192143564-00ae82a5-55ac-4c87-abec-5baa9bbc1f0b.png)
![Screenshot 2022-09-25 203723](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192143773-76b71e07-7310-44b2-a34e-1022f4d02ff6.png)

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Text Styles

Some of the text colors would change with the theme color.

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 025053](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192114108-06e98831-c1f6-4dc4-b754-3a98bb6315dc.png)

Let's compare the difference after the theme color changed:

![Screenshot 2022-09-26 002351](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192154325-b19c269b-2c6c-42ab-82d9-87751f96e7aa.png)

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Code Block Syntax Highlight

ReMoods Theme provides over 80% consistent syntax highlighting styles for the code block of Markdown Editor and Render Viewer.

![Screenshot 2022-09-26 000631](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192153453-4d51e804-769d-47f8-abac-0794ad4266a1.png)

Syntax Highlight would change with the theme color too:

![Screenshot 2022-09-26 003511](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192154770-10349a7e-6364-4ff4-a9f7-3caa95771865.png)

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Floating TOC 

Joplin provides us a great built-in Markdown TOC feature which let you create the TOC by typing a simple command `[[toc]]` within your notes. ReMoods has restyled it and made it floating at the bottom right of the Render Viewer. It would open up when mouse hovers on the TOC button.

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 032314](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192115112-9432ac02-94de-4894-b0a6-3fcc8333d32f.png)

### Hints

The Markdown TOC feature is disabled by Joplin default. To use the Markdown TOC, you should enable the extension manually.

To enable the TOC feature:
1. Go to `Options` > `Markdown`
2. Checked `Enable table of contents extension (wysiwyg:no)`

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Eye-Protector

![IMG_20211114_145258_HDR1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192705530-e3a3329c-2419-4f00-a9fa-fa246a5e6699.jpg)

All attached images and mermaid charts will default to 20% darker than the original, to avoid bright light flashing your eyes while reading the notes. Hovering over them will restore the original brightness slowly.

You can disable it by going to `Options` > `ReMoods Theme` and unchecking the `Enable Eye-Protector effect for mermaid charts` or `Enable Eye-Protector effect for images`.

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

# CUSTOM ELEMENTS

ReMoods Theme provides a lot of custom elements to help you create a better reading experience, and here are the 6 major kinds:

- Art Gallery
- Sticky Notes
- Custom Title Block
- Key Point
- Key Mention

### Hints

If Joplin is your only place to take notes, you can just use the Custom Elements without thinking. Otherwise, you should notice the below:

1. Custom Elements are unique HTML Elements and CSS Styles for ReMoods Theme, so it might become plain text format when you transfer your notes to other software.
2. Even if other software is support customize CSS, you should still need to copy the related codes from ReMoods to another software manually.

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Art Gallery 

Art Gallery provides 11 custom elements for you to split attached images into multiple columns. It would be helpful if you have many images needed to attach to your note. 

Art Gallery has limited the `max-height` to 56% viewport height by default. Let's see how it works:

| Custom Elements | Force Columns |
|:---------------:|:-------------:|
|       ag2       |       2       |
|       ag3       |       3       |
|       ag4       |       4       |
|       ag5       |       5       |
|       ag6       |       6       |
|       ag7       |       7       |
|       ag8       |       8       |
|       ag9       |       9       |
|       ag10      |       10      |
|       ag11      |       11      |
|       ag12      |       12      |

Below is the sample of the art gallery(ag6) with 30 images: 

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 171257](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192136954-9ef7c0e7-9bf7-466d-a945-dcc222df3ff1.png)

### Hints

1. The custom element name `ag` stands for *Art Gallery*.
2. The art gallery tag must use *right behind the plain text* .
3. Do not include any blank line within this part of the codes, *blank line will break the format* .

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Sticky Notes 

ReMoods has 8 custom elements for creating the Sticky Notes: `note` , `tip` , `question` , `explain` , `warning` , `comment`, `keyword` , `important`. They can help you build the article structure. Normally, you would be removed them from the content when you have completed your article. 

Letâ€™s see what are the Sticky Notes for:

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 193253](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192141288-388a53d8-e9d2-4177-9ef8-40ebb4149d01.png)

### Hints

1. Make sure there is a blank line *before the open tag*, otherwise it may cause the format problem.
2. Start typing your content in a *new line*.
3. Use plain text within a custom element.
4. Use `ENTER` to add a line break.
5. Do not include any blank line within the Sticky Notes, if you want to add a *blank line* please use  `<br>`.

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Custom Title Block

Custom Title Block would be suitable for supplementing information that you think is important to readers. The use is very similar to a blockquote but coming up with a clear heading, it's making a key concept more outstanding.

Let's see what it looks like:

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 180612](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192138206-2c66c33d-5121-40bf-a5aa-2227d17c8260.png)

### Hints

1. The custom element name `ctb` stands for *Custom Title Block*.
2. Type your title *next to the open tag* .
3. Keep your title *within one line*.
4. Start typing your content *in the second line*.
5. Use plain text within a custom element.
6. Please mention that *within one line* means it's *according to your panel width*.

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Key Point

The custom element Key Point is super useful when you want to split out a paragraph without using the Heading or Strong Text. It also can keep your mind clear from the sense of overly using the Strong Text or Heading. The usage is very similar to the HTML Description List element.

3 best timing to use the Key Point:

1. To keep *multiple paragraphs* of content stay within *one heading*.
2. To *explain a part of content* that with *multiple key points* and each one has *a paragraph of description*.
3. To avoid using Strong Text to *create a paragraph*. (keep your strong text only appearing within a paragraph's content.)

See it below:

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 181155](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192138395-287ca10b-4abf-4b57-99e7-eb7f89634120.png)

### Hints

1. The custom element name `kp` stands for *Key Point*.
2. I recommend **only** use it at *the beginning of the line*.
3. It **cannot** be used within *any other block elements* such as Custom Title Block, Spoiler Block, Sticky Notes, etc...

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Key Mention

The custom element Key Mention is good to use as an additional short information. Use it right behind a target element, and you will see it presented to the right. You can use it to remark on the last update time of the table and paragraph. Or you can use it like the HTML `<cite>` tag.

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 185512](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192140048-a6384ac9-069b-4d88-924c-9eb4a64c778a.png)

### Hints

1. The custom element name `km` stands for *Key Mention*.
2. Always use `km` **right behind the target element** which you want to describe.
3. Use the Joplin built-in function `Insert Date Time` to make it easy.
4. You can also use `km` within any Sticky Notes, and if you do that, please make sure `km` is always the **first child** inside the Sticky Notes.
5. The text strong, emphasize, insert, and strikethrough will present as red color when inside the `km`.
6. Mouse hover on it to zoom bigger.

More use cases:

# THIRD-PARTY PLUGINS STYLING

The third-party plugin styling is aimed to keep the plugin styles consistent with the theme, and secondly is to add extra functions for using them in ReMoods. Let's keep reading the below.

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Spoiler 

This plugin allows you to create inline spoilers and spoiler blocks with title and extendable body. And the below shows what Spoiler looks like in ReMoods:

Let's take a look at the spoiler block:

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 233436](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192151983-f7da56cc-add8-4638-9224-60abeb4894c7.png)

### Hints

ReMoods has created 4 more custom styles that you can use within the Spoiler block for advanced use:

1. Spoiler Block > Span
2. Spoiler Block > List
3. Spoiler Block > List > Span
4. Spoiler Block > Custom Title Block

Quick setting up:

1. Open Joplin
2. Go to `tools` > `Options` > `Plugins`
3. Search the plugin by inputting the word `spoiler`
4. Click `Install` which is on the `Spoiler`
5. Quit & restart Joplin app

[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Markdown Table Colorize

This plugin adds colors to the markdown table syntax, so you can quickly identify what column the content belongs to.

Sometimes, Markdown table syntax can be very messy when too much information is within the table. Thanks to the Markdown Table Colorize plugin, ReMoods can create a better style for the markdown table now!

After installing the Markdown Table Colorize plugin and ReMoods, you will see the markdown table syntax looks like below:

![Screenshot 2022-09-25 234159](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110529913/192152301-b4e3608d-f4f7-4191-a80e-8f804b117dc9.png)

- Separating table rows into independent sections
- Use colored letters as a column mark
- Column marks support up to 52 columns
- Mouse hover on the column mark to zoom bigger

### Hints

I would like to share the steps of how I create a markdown table. And these steps are perfect for this plugin style.

First to create the table structure:

```
||||||
||||||
||||||
```

Then, add the format to it:

```
||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|
||||||
```

Last, add content to it:

```
|TH|TH|TH|TH|TH|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|TD|TD|TD|TD|TD|
```

Quick setting up:

1. Open Joplin
2. Go to `tools` > `Options` > `Plugins`
3. Search the plugin by inputting the word `color`
4. Click `Install` on the `Markdown Table: Colorize`
5. Quit & restart Joplin app

# PRINT & EXPORT



[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Export HTML File 



[:arrow_up:Back](#table-of-contents)

## Export PDF Document

- In ReMoods, Print & Export PDF is the standalone part that is separated from the Render Viewer styles. So, it means you can set different fonts and font sizes for Print & Export PDF use, and it won't affect the styles within Joplin.
- You can also control what elements should show on the PDF through the ReMoods Theme settings page, such as hide the Sticky Notes, hide the Key Mention, hide the notebook title, etc.
